# Collection-of-Various-Projects
In this you will find 2 games made in Unity. Each of them were tutorials I followed to help myself learn the Unity game engine. The last item in here is my Goblet Player my team created in AP Computer Science. Goblet is a board game and we developed a player strategy for our character. We ran our player against various bots on the RIT server. What is included is just the code to look at. I unfortunately no longer have access to the server it ran on.
